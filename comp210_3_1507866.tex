\section{VR Interfaces and Evaluation}
Mentzelopoulos \textit{et al} researched hardware interfaces for VR \cite{Mentzelopoulos}.

The interface can be evaluated using a heuristics analysis \cite{Nielsen, Pinelle}.The analysis can be used identify weaknesses in the interface and improve on them. Pinelle \textit{et al} created a series of heuristics specific to game usability. These heuristics can be used to analysis a VR interface. However Pinelle's heuristics were not designed for use in VR games some heuristics may not apply or need to be altered.

Sutcliffe presented a method based on Nielson's heuristics to analyse virtual environments

\section{VR Controls}
The Frustration --- Aggression model says that aggression is caused by a person being blocked from reaching their goals \cite{dollard1939frustration}.  This can be applied to games as some factor can prevent the player from obtaining their in game goal.  Przybylski \textit{et al}'s work showed that it is not necessarily violence in video games that causes player aggression and frustration. They suggest that it is instead competence impeding controls that cause aggression \cite{przybylski, przybylski2010motivational}. These competence impeding controls block that player from performing their desired in game action causing frustration.
