\subsection{Hardware Interfaces for VR Applications: Evaluation on Prototypes \cite{Mentzelopoulos}}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Recommended reading 	
	\item VR improves game experience 
	\item VR interfaces should let the user use them spontaneously / without explanation
	\item A good VR system should consider:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item  The user will be provide with a full field of vision display, usually produced by the wearing of a H.M.D.
			\item Tracking of the position and attitude of the participant's body
			\item Computer tracking of the participant's movements and actions
			\item Negligible delay in updating the display with feedback from the body's movements and actions.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Produced two games one for xbox 1 controller other for razer hydra controller
	\item Razer controller very adaptable 
	\item One game was action adventure the other was first person puzzle
	\item Only evaluated on 18 students - not many??  Only students in computing/computer science courses
	\item Xbox controller was easier to use, but both the same after tutorials - user needs to know how to use equipment
	\item Game using Razer controllers more fun - could be linked to motion controls
	\item Action game caused more motion sickness  		
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Human factors issues in virtual environments: A review of the literature \cite{stanney}}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Recommended reading 	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Competence-impeding electronic games and playersâ€™ aggressive feelings, thoughts, and behaviours \cite{przybylski}}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Paper about bad controls in games making players violent 
	\item Aggression could be linked to Self-Determination Theory (SDT) 
	\item Aggression can be linked to video games by GAM/SLT
	\item Bad controls make players feel lack of competence
	\item VR is relatively new so controls are still experimental
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Hand tracking
		\item How player moves in game
		\item Whether the UI is suited to VR
	\end{itemize}	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Can virtual reality be better controlled by a smart phone than by a mouse and a keyboard? \cite{Kovarova}}

\begin{itemize}
	\item I'm using a smart phone as my interface in my VR assignment	
	\item Traditional keyboard and mouse can be restrictive in VR games
	\item Keyboard and mouse aren't as natural/intuitive as touch screens
	\item Smart phones have most of the sensors needed to be a controller 
	\item It's not suitable for all types of game though
	\item Many people own smart phones so would be cheaper than buying specific controllers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Homuncular Flexibility in Virtual Reality \cite{won2015homuncular}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
\end{itemize}
